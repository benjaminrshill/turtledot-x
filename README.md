#### weekly itemiser

***

#### items 
- add regular items/tasks to your collection
- give each item a weekly target
- categorise tasks by colour

#### arrange
- add items to the current and next weeks
- unobtrusive alert if you're not matching your target for an item
- (desktop only) drag and drop items to rearrange rows

#### do it
- check off items for this week
- if you meet your target, get a satisfying 'blackout' for that item

#### clear
- want to start again? clear your items, weeks, or everything, with dedicated buttons

a more robust version, with long-term history and device syncing, is in the works
